    "domain": "DOMAIN:\n ENZYMES is a dataset of protein tertiary structures obtained from (Borgwardt et al., 2005) consisting of 600 enzymes from the BRENDA enzyme database (Schomburg et al., 2004). In this case the task is to correctly assign each enzyme to one of the 6 EC top-level classes.\n\nCASSES:\n1: Oxidoreductasas\n2: Transferasas\n3: Hidrolasas\n4: Liasas\n5: Isomerasas\n6: Ligasas\n\nHere's the structure of the 18 node attributes (per node = one secondary-structure element, SSE) in ENZYMES:\n\n1-2) SSE size (2)\n- Amino-acid length - number of residues in the SSE.\n- 3D length - distance (in Ångströms) between the C-alpha of the first and last residue of the SSE.\n\n3-6) Property totals (4)\nAggregate (e.g., sum/mean) of each property across residues in the SSE:\n- Total hydrophobicity\n- Total polarity\n- Total polarizability\n- Total (normalized) van der Waals volume\n\n7-18) 3-bin distributions per property (12 = 4x3)\nFor each of the four properties above, three values capturing how the property is distributed within the SSE across low / medium / high ranges:\n- Hydrophobicity (low, mid, high)\n- Polarity (low, mid, high)\n- Polarizability (low, mid, high)\n- van der Waals volume (low, mid, high)\n\nNotes:\n- The node label (SSE type: helix / sheet / turn) is separate from these 18 continuous attributes.\n- The three-bin values are typically fractions (or normalized counts) of residues in each bin.\n\n\n• Each node is a secondary-structure element (SSE) of the protein (helix, sheet, or turn).\n  - Node label: SSE type (helix/sheet/turn).\n  - Node attributes: 18 continuous features (sizes + physico-chemical summaries).\n\n• Each edge connects two SSEs if:\n  1) They are neighbors along the amino-acid sequence (adjacent SSEs), OR\n  2) They are among the three nearest neighbors in 3D space (spatial proximity).\n\n"
